# RaylibGraphVisualizer

## Description
Raylib Graph Visualizer is a graphical tool designed for visualizing graph algorithms. Built on top of the Raylib library, the project aims to provide a clear and interactive platform to understand how different graph algorithms work. While it currently supports Breadth-First Search (BFS) visualization, future updates are planned to include additional graph algorithm visualizations.
